## How it works

1. Install & connect repo or CI integration  
2. Scan: AI SAST + SCA + Secrets + SBOM analysis runs on PRs & commits  
3. Triage: high-confidence findings with context and fix suggestions  
4. Remediate: apply AI Autofix PRs or manual patch guidance

## Deep Dive

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AI SAST — What makes it different?">
    Unlike traditional SAST, Enforster AI analyzes execution paths, data flow and code intent to reduce false positives while surfacing exploit chains and risky patterns.

    - Context-aware scoring  
    - Cross-file exploit chain detection  
    - Actionable remediation guidance
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SCA & SBOM — Protect your supply chain">
    Automatic SBOM generation and continuous monitoring help you detect typosquatting, dependency confusion and malicious package injections early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secrets Scanning & Response">
    Scans code, history, PRs and container images. When a secret is found, Enforster AI surfaces revoke steps and opens a remediation ticket.
