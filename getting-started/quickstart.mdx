## 1. Create Your Enforster AI Account

Visit [app.enforster.ai](https://app.enforster.ai) and sign up for a free Enforster AI account.

Our streamlined onboarding process will guide you through the initial setup, helping you configure your security scanning environment quickly and efficiently.

## 2. Connect Your Codebase

The next step involves connecting your project to Enforster AI. We provide multiple integration methods to suit your workflow preferences:

Navigate to the Repository section then clicking the "Integrate Repository" button in your Enforster AI dashboard.

Choose from these integration options:

- **GitHub/Gitlab Integration (Recommended)**: Seamlessly connect your GitHub or Gitlab repositories for automatic scanning
- **Direct Upload**: Upload your project files as a compressed archive
- **Public Repository URL**: Provide a direct link to your publicly accessible code repository

Enforster AI does not store your repositories data. All senstive data get deleted once scanned get completed. We only store short vulnerable code snippet and filenames.
Enforster AI prioritizes data security and privacy. We maintain enterprise-grade security standards throughout our platform. For detailed information about our security protocols, refer to our comprehensive security documentation.


## 3. Initiate Security Scanning

After connecting your project, you can begin security analysis using one of these approaches:

**AI-Powered Scanning**: If you have our advanced AI scanning engine enabled, you can start a comprehensive security scan directly from the Enforster AI interface.


Once processing begins, Enforster AI will analyze your codebase and security data, then redirect you to your personalized dashboard to review the comprehensive analysis results.

## 4. Analyze Security Results

Enforster AI employs sophisticated artificial intelligence to evaluate potential security vulnerabilities and distinguish between genuine threats and false positives. Our AI analysis considers multiple factors including:

- Code context and surrounding logic
- Vulnerability characteristics and patterns
- Industry best practices and coding standards
- Historical data and similar code patterns
- Intelligent reduced false positive.

For confirmed vulnerabilities, Enforster AI generates intelligent remediation suggestions, complete with detailed explanations of the security issue and the reasoning behind each proposed solution.
